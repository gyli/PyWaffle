# Figure and Axis Manipulation

## Update plot with returned Figure and Axes

You are free to modify the figure generated by `Waffle` class. 
You may get all axes in the figure through property [Figure.axes](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/figure_api.html#matplotlib.figure.Figure.axes), and modify them through the list.

For example, if you would like to remove the auto-generated legend, and save the figure into a file, you can update the axis through `axes` property and then call `savefig()` with the returned figure:

```python
fig = plt.figure(
    FigureClass=Waffle,
    rows=5,
    columns=10,
    values={'Cat1': 30, 'Cat2': 16, 'Cat3': 4},
)

# Remove legend
fig.axes[0].get_legend().remove()

# Save the figure into a file
fig.savefig("my_plot.png")
```

## Make Waffle on Existed Axis

Sometimes you might have figure and axis created already, and you would like to plot waffle chart on top of 
it, without creating a new figure. In this case, you may use `Waffle.make_waffle()` function, which accepts axis `ax` and other arguments available in `Waffle`.

> **_NOTE:_** `Waffle.make_waffle()` is a classmethod, and you should call it without creating a new `Waffle` instance.

> **_NOTE:_** The only argument that is available in Waffle but unsupported in `Waffle.make_waffle()` is `plots`, since it only accept one axis. Thus, this function can only generate waffle chart in a single plot.

Below is an example showing that you may create and modify the figure and axis first, and then pass the axis to `Waffle.make_waffle()` for waffle chart plotting.

```python
fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.add_subplot(111)

# Modify existed axis
ax.set_title("Axis Title")
ax.set_aspect(aspect="equal")

Waffle.make_waffle(
    ax=ax,  # pass axis to make_waffle
    rows=5, 
    columns=10, 
    values=[30, 16, 4], 
    title={"label": "Waffle Title", "loc": "left"}
)
```
